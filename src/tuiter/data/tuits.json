It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars"

    "tuit": "Autopilot is an advanced driver assistance system that enhances safety and convenience behind the wheel. When used properly, Autopilot reduces your overall workload as a driver. Each new Tesla vehicle is equipped with eight external cameras and powerful vision processing to provide an additional layer of safety. All vehicles built for the North American market now use our camera-based Tesla Vision to deliver Autopilot features, rather than radar.\n\nAutopilot comes standard on every new Tesla. For owners who took delivery of their cars without Autopilot, there are multiple packages available for purchase, depending on when your car was built: Autopilot, Enhanced Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability."
